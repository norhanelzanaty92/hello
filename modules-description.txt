DIO:
this module configures our microcolntroller pins direction ,values in both cases (Read/Write cases)
enabling user to utilize these configuration in whatever applications he implements.
it works only on atmega32 with 32 pins only
ADC:
this module helps user to read from analog channels either one channel or group of channels in microcontrollers enables and disables the ADC 
component.
it reads positive voltages only.
LCD:
this module enables user to configure the LCD 16*2 and to write a string on it 
BUZZER:
this module enablesuser for sending 1 to the buzzer through microcontroller to alarm that the temperature has risen than the threshold.
it works only on 5v 
T-SENSOR
this module uses ADC to read positive voltages and turns them to positive temperature degrees so we can keep tracking the room temperature changes 
it cant read excpet positive voltages ( positive temperatures)only.
